# 🧠 Machine Learning Progress Tracker (GitHub-Style)

Track your daily and weekly progress on ML-related work, including reading papers, building models, improving problem-solving skills, and staying grounded.

---

## ✅ Weekly Goals
- [ ] Read 1 ML/AI paper and summarize it
- [ ] Implement 1 new model or algorithm
- [ ] Solve 5 ML coding problems (e.g., LeetCode, Kaggle)
- [ ] Study 1 concept deeply (e.g., backpropagation, transformers)
- [ ] Write a blog post or notes summary (optional)
- [ ] Participate in a discussion forum / Discord group

---

## 🗓️ Daily Checklist (Repeat for 30 Days)
### 📆 Day `X`
- [ ] 🎯 Intention: _(e.g., “Stay curious even if I fail”)_
- [ ] 🧠 ML Learning (1-2 hrs)
- [ ] 🛠️ Coding/Implementation
- [ ] 📚 Read/skim paper or blog (20-30 mins)
- [ ] 💭 Reflection: What did I learn today?
- [ ] 📌 Note one practical application or idea
- [ ] 🔁 Review past notes (5 mins)
- [ ] 📈 Track your energy + mood (1 to 10)

---

## 💡 Monthly Reflection Prompts (at end of each 4-week cycle)
- What part of ML excites me most right now?
- What project did I enjoy building/working on most?
- What blockers did I face this month, and how did I respond?
- What’s one thing I want to get really good at next month?

---

## 🌱 Ideas to Stay Curious and Focused
- Follow arXiv-sanity or Papers with Code
- Read one ML repo’s code on GitHub per week
- Watch 1 conference talk or workshop (e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR)
- Maintain a "Why-Why-Why" file (ask why until it becomes intuitive)

---

## 🗃️ Optional Sections
### 📁 Project Backlog (Ideas to Work On)
- [ ] Demand forecasting using LSTM
- [ ] Classify satellite images (Geospatial)
- [ ] Build a basic recommender engine
- [ ] Deploy model with Flask + Streamlit
- [ ] Fine-tune a T5 summarizer

### 🧪 Experiments Tracker
| Date | Model | Dataset | Metric | Observations |
|------|-------|---------|--------|--------------|
|      |       |         |        |              |

### 📌 Key Metrics To Track
- Time spent on real coding vs passive learning
- Number of bugs solved independently
- Improvement in validation/test metrics
- Confidence in explaining model intuition
